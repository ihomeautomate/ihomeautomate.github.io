It feels like we were waiting for the Z-Wave micro modules for too many years&#8230; but now, they have finally arrived. According to rumours we can expect two different manufacturers, giving their best shot at the Z-Wave micro module market around the end of September 2011. Will this be the end of the older-skool X10 based Marmitek / Xanura micro modules? I would certainly hope so :-).

Line-up:

* Aeon Labs &#8211; [http://www.aeon-labs.com][1]
* Fibaro &#8211; [http://www.fibaro.com][2]


##### Aeon Labs
Available as in-wall on/off, dimmer and blind module, and with rumoured dimensions of 51x49x19mm:

##### Marmitek (no z-wave / for comparison only)
Since we&#8217;re listing dimensions anyway, the older Marmitek AW12 module had the following dimensions: 46x46x17mm.

Hopefully more news soon!
