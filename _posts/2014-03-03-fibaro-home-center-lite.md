The <a href="http://www.ihomeautomate.eu/2014/02/28/update-for-week-9-2014/" title="Fibaro Home Center Lite" target="_blank">rumoured Fibaro Home Center Lite</a> is expected to arrive this week in most European Z-Wave shops.

Here&#8217;s what we know already:  
&#8211; Small, smaller, smallest: hurray for its size: 90x90x33mm  
&#8211; Running on an energy efficient ARM Cortex A8 processor (720MHz)  
&#8211; Claimed to manage your TV, Home Cinema, Hi-Fi and others &#8211; right from the Fibaro app: you don’t need any remote other than your smart phone or tablet

But remember:  
&#8211; No LUA scripting language  
&#8211; No VoIP  
&#8211; No LiLi (voice control)

It&#8217;s expected to be priced below 299€, head over to your local z-wave dealer for more detailed information :-). Keep us informed!
