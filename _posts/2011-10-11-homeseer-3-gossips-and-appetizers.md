I&#8217;ve compiled a list of statements and other chatter regarding HomeSeer 3 (in chronological order). For the latest gossip, scroll down :).



**2009, December**  
*>>How far away is HS3?*
  
> Light years away until we sit down and make the decisions on what goes in there and start figuring how long it will take.

**2010, September**
  
> The fact of the matter is that Z-Wave is handled by several class objects that do not even get initialized if Z-Wave is not used, so there is no significant additional memory used by having Z-Wave in the code.
<br/>However, because of a decision that we have made with regard to HS3, it is very likely that Z-Wave will be moved into a plug-in or a separate executable module of some type. So while it will never happen in HS2, and would not have happened in HS3 had we not made this other change, we probably now will.

**2011, July**
  
> Our software is incredibly complex because of the many interdependencies between it and the technologies it integrates with. We did the best that we could internally and via beta to test HS2 but the reality is that we couldn&#8217;t possibly test for all the variables you guys throw at it! So yes&#8230; HS2 definitely had some bugs that needed squashing. The good news with HS3 is that most of the changes will be focused on the GUI, on making the program easier to use and better organized (for devices and events). It does not represent a complete rewrite, as HS2 did.

> 08/26/2011 10:53 AM I&#8217;m impatient. Hmmm! Anybody know when (and if) we are allowed to beta test HS3?<br/>
08/26/2011 7:50 PM @Moskus: We&#8217;re several months away from a beta. Hang in there

**2011, October**
  
> The event engine is being completely re-engineered. A new status view is being implemented. JQuery is being introduced into the web GUI.  
[Source][5]

**2011, October**
  
> The bulk of Bugzilla issues will be addressed in HS3 once that program is in alpha/beta testing phase.  
[Source][6]

**2011, October**
  
> Web services will be in HS3, so you will be able to connect remotely easily with any app that supports sockets. We will be using this new interface for the speaker client on the Linux version.  
Once we get an HS3 build working and the screens solidified, I will start a new HS3 thread and start discussing the new features, screen shots, etc. I hesitate to give any dates, but we are getting things together very quickly now, won&#8217;t be long.
