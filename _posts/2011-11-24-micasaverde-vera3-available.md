It looks like the [Vera3][1] (quitely) sneaked in the available stock on [MiCasaVerde][2]. The specifications are the same as previously mentioned on the [wiki][3]:

  * CPU 500M Hz MIPS SoC
  * Flash NAND 32 MB
  * SDRAM 32 MB DDR2
  * Memory DDR2 128 MB
  * 2xUSB Port
  * 1xWAN Port (10/100 Mbit/sec)
  * 4xLAN Port 4 (10/100 Mbit/sect)
  * Z-Wave Built-in with internal antenna
  * Dimensions (HxWxD) 177mm x 130mm x 34mm

Now we&#8217;re still waiting for the at CEDIA showed VeraLite, having a built-in battery compartment for making inclusion of Z-Wave devices into the network easier, and its lack of Wi-Fi. Hopefully in time to make it under the christmas tree.

**2011-11-25, update:**  
It looks like Vera3 will be available [somewhere in December][4], &#8220;EU Vera3 Dealer pre-orders will ship December 12th and customer pre-orders December 15th.&#8221;
