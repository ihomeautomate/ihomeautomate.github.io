Last year [HomeSeer][1] released their home automation controller based on the Raspberry Pi: [HomeTroller Zee][2]. A few weeks ago they released its HS3-Pi software hoping to give existing Raspberry Pi&#8217;s (yet) another purpose.

**As far as we know it supports the following interfaces:**

  * Z-Wave (via Aeon Labs Z-Stick or Z-Wave.Me daughter card) 
  * Insteon (via Smarthome 2413U PLM) 
  * X10 (via CM11, CM15 or TI103) 

Luckily, as with any HS3, it includes HSTouch Server out-of-box. But be aware, it is rumoured that HS3-Pi does not accept remote plugin connections.

**Some interesting Q&A:**

  Does it allow the normal 30-day trial that the Windows version does?
    
> I&#8217;m pretty sure it does. You can just use the guide to create your own SD image and double check! 

If we already have HS3 PRO do we get a license for HS3PI?
 
> Your HS3PRO license will also work with the HS3PRO Linux version of the software. HS3-Pi is not the same software and uses different licensing.
