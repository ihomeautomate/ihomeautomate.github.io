Get back to school, get back to work&#8230; summertime is over! Here&#8217;s a short HS3 rumour round-up.
While lots of plugin developers (among others) are working/questioning/gathering intel regarding HS3 versions of (their) plugins, here&#8217;s what we do know:

**2012, July 19**
  
> We are getting close to getting out the SDK for 3rd party plugin developers, that is the next milestone.  
[Source][1]

**2012, August 7**
  
> We are finalizing the SDK for our plugin developers and should have that out shortly. We are targeting this fall for a beta release.
