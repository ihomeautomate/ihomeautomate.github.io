As you can read in previous post(s) I have been playing around on the Android platform to get a (simple) HSTouch replacement on my mobile device. Since a few months an official (beta) HSTouch for Android is published, so I was thinking of re-using part of my Android code as a library for a 100% pure java HomeSeer client, and I moved on to the official HSTouch (beta) on my Android mobile device.

So in the mean time, I have a small Tomcat Java web application on an Ubuntu Linux server, interfaced directly with my HomeSeer setup at home. Without any .NET, DLL, ActiveX or mono components installed, only running on a standard Java VM. The Jave HomeSeer client receives its updates instantly from HomeSeer similar to any other HSTouch device. Of course it counts as an extra HSTouch connection, which are limited (unless you buy the unlimited connections plugin), but nevertheless it&#8217;s very nice to have.

Feel free to discuss :).
