##### x64 vs x86  
Some people seem to have issues getting it to work on 64-bit Windows versions. The original code was deployed to a 32-bit Windows XP machine, which seem to run fine.

##### More improvements  
I hope to find time to improve and document the plugin. For now please stick to the above :-).

##### [Fork me][3]  
I&#8217;ve uploaded the plugin code to a [github repository][4]. Feel free to improve where needed.
