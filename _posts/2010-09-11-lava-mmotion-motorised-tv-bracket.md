A motorised TV bracket sounds great? Here is how I mounted mine.

Requisites:

  * LAVA mMotion LRM901L by [People of Lava](http://www.peopleoflava.com/mounts/mmotion_swing)
  * TV (in my case a Bravia Z4500 46&#8243;)
  * Toolbox

First, I would definately recommend to get help when moving your TV :). Of course don&#8217;t forget to read through the manual and installation guide first. I would even say, read thoroughly! It might look easy, however the first time it might be a bit adventurous. Luckily there are 2 youtube movies providing the necessary how-to action.

This first movie shows how to properly mount the bracket to the TV. I found that there are some instructions that could be misinterpreted when reading the manual.

My problem was that I could not mount the bracket to the correct spot on my Bravia Z4500. The connections for coax (TV) and RJ45 (network) were exactly on the place where the brackets&#8217; arms needed to be, making it difficult to do easy plug-and-play. I&#8217;ve resolved this by adjusting the arms accordingly and using a better fitting coax plug. Still, it isn&#8217;t easy to plug in when the bracket is already mounted. So I would recommends, plug everything in while mounting and leave the cables :).

A second movie shows what&#8217;s next.

Good luck!
