MarketReportsOnline have made a report available, estimating that the home automation market will grow from $16,888.27 million in 2011 to $35,627.83 million in 2016, at a year-over-year growth rate of 16.1 percent. 

The move from wired to wireless technology with technologies such as Zigbee and Z-Wave, as well as the introduction of standards and (open?) protocols should make it all happen. Home automation systems will be able to interact and integrate with each other more easily and be controlled by users over the internet via smartphones, tablets and other (touchscreen) controllers.

I guess all this does sound pretty familiar. I definitely see more and more (non geeky) people interested in energy management, multi-room entertainment and control-it-all-from-my-couch-mobile-apps. The [retro-fit micro modules][1] will surely help out the boost. Time will tell!
